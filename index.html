<p class="bio">JunctionBox.ca is the personal blog of Nathan Fisher, a senior systems engineer at <a href="http://www.maxymiser.com/">maxymiser.com</a>. The <a href="">Archive</a> contains my musings on development, <a href="/devops.html">DevOps</a> and IT related articles. The <a href="/resources/">Resource</a> section is a dumping ground for links to interesting tools, OS's, and tips I've found on the web. <a href="/nathan-fisher.html">About Nathan</a> is a short overview of me, myself and I...as if a blog wasn't self-indulgent enough! Oh and while I'd hope this is self evident any views expressed here are mine and not those of my employer.</p>
