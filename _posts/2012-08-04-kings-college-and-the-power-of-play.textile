Sunny day in Cambridge and down goes the laptop. This years summer requires that you make the most of any opportunity the weather provides. Today I travelled into town with Val and wandered through a few of the colleges. One of the things that really struck me was the chapel at "Kings College":http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/chapel/. The vaulted ceiling is amazing, knowing that it was constructed over 600 years ago and largely inspired by "playing" with wooden blocks is a little humbling.  The construction follows the basic rules of keystone archways but, in three dimensional wonder.  Now if only I had a quarry at my disposal and that 100m x 50m plot of land that's so easy to come by in the UK. The full scale version took almost 100 years so perhaps I should consider a smaller version.  Apparently the "fan vault":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_vault at Kings is the largest of it's kind but, is found in a few other chapels.  If it weren't for the heating costs I'd seriously consider it for my next house.
