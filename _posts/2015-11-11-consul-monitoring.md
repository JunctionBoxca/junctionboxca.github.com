Tired and somewhat bored of using Nagios and Zabbix I was inspired and curious how difficult it would be to setup Consul for monitoring. I've used the TTL mechanism previously as part of service discovery but I was curious as to how useful it would be as a monitoring system.

The environment I'm in at the moment is somewhat traditional in that it follows tiered security zones with a strict flow of ingress and egress. As a result I wouldn't consider

Required Materials

- Consul.
- Consul UI.
- Service with HTTP HealthCheck.
