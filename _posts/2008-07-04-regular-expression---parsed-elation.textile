Here's a little app I wrote during a project to test ActionScript 3's regular expressions.
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="/images/as3regex.swf" width="760" height="422">
<param name="movie" value="/images/as3regex.swf" />
</object>

h2. Character Classes

* \w - word character [A-Za-z0-9_]
* \W - non-word character [^\w]
* \s - space character [ \t\r\n]
* \S - non-space character [^\s]
* \d - digit  [0-9]
* \D - non-digit character [^\d]

h2. Avoiding Back-tracking

h3. Negative boundary matching

/"[^"]*"/ - match all characters between double quotes

h3. Atomic Groups

/"(?>[^"]*)"/ - drops positions after a match is made
