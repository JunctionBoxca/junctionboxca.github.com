Looking to throw together a quick app in Flash to test Sprouts I decided on working with AsWing.  Here's some of the process I followed to get the environment up and going.

Install the sprouts gem;

@# sudo gem install sprouts@

Download the latest aswing package;

"AsWing on Google Code":http://code.google.com/p/aswing/downloads/list

Create a new project;

@# sprout -n as3 TickTock@

Copy AsWing.swc into TickTock/lib.

Modify the debug task in TickTock/rakefile.rb as illustrated:

<pre>
desc 'Compile and debug the application'
debug :debug do |t|
  t.input = 'src/TickTock.as'
  t.library_path << "lib/AsWing.swc"
end
</pre>
