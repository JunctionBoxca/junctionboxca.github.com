Well it appears there's an undocumented limit on number of "rewrite rules":http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/HowDoIWebsiteConfiguration.html#configure-bucket-as-website-routing-rule-syntax you can use with an S3 bucket.  The magic number that I've found so far?

A measly 20! When you exceed that number you'll get an error stating; &ldquo;You can't have more than ROUTING_RULE_COUNT Routing Rules on the same website configuration.&rdquo;
