Clojure start-up time can be expensive especially when using ClojureScript. Here's a couple items I've used to cut down start-up test execution time down:

h3. Run all namespaces

```
lein test
```

h3. Run a namespace

```
lein test :only cc.jbx.blog
```

h3. Run a test case

```
lein test :only cc.jbx.blog/test-rendering-post
```

h3. Run in the REPL 

```
lein repl
(use 'clojure.test)
(defn test-blog []
"""
This is just a little helper function to make reloading and running the tests more efficient.
"""
(require 'cc.jbx.blog :reload-all)
(run-tests 'cc.jbx.blog))

(test-blog)
```
