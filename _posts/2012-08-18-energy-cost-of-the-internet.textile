It is estimated there are 33m servers in the world [["1":#gigaom]]. So let's do some quick napkin math (there's massive holes here which I'll detail later).  Assuming 450W/server [["2":#opencompute]] average that's 14.85 gigawatts of power consumption per hour.  To put that in perspective the Fukushima power plant had a maximum functional output of 4,696 megawatts [["3":#fukushima]]. To power all of those servers it would take a little over 3 Fukushima power plants running at peak capacity.  Keep in mind 4,696 megawatts can service approximately 2,141,376 UK homes (assumes 4kWh annual consumption [["4":#ukpower]] ).  The mathematical short-cut is to say 1 server is roughly equal to 1 homes' annual consumption. Below is a table of calculations in case I made a mistake somewhere.

|_. Desc |_. Calculation |
| Servers | 33,000,000 |
| Server (kWh) | 0.45 |
| Server Total (MWh) | 33,000,000 * 0.45 = 14,850 |
| Fukushima peak capacity (kWh) | 4,696,000 |
| Fukushima Required | 14,850 / 4,696 = 3.16 |
| Annual UK Household consumption (kWh) | 4000 |
| Hourly consumption | 4000/365/24 = 0.456kWh |
| Homes/Fukushima | 4,696,000/0.456 = 2,141,376 |

Now I said this was back of the napkin, which makes all of these calculations a gross over-simplification.  Nuclear reactors do not run at peak capicity, nor do servers consume .45kWh all the time.  Both are generally less in their respective output (~3.4MWh) and consumption (wildly variable).  However, given there's a whole whack of other things hiding behind the scenes like network gear, UPS's, line conditioners, duplicate rails of power, disk arrays, power factor (A/C's best friend), the list goes on... basically I feel confident but not certian the estimate is on the low end.

h3. What's the point?

Abstraction is a powerful tool but, we should peel it back occassionally to understand what's happening under the hood. There's a lot of talk that cloud computing is a panacea for our carbon footprint. That maybe true but, only if we consume less and turn servers off when we're done with them. The best thing to do is know you're off-peak hours and consider powering off some of your servers.  It'll help the environment and test that the init scripts are working as expected. :)
