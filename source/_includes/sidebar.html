<h3>Nathan Fisher - DevOp</h3>
 
<p class="quiet">DevOps is a common sense approach to software release cycles. It's an accumulation of best practices and the agreement that software has no business value until it's in the hands of its intended user. The name is derived from the curious union of development and operations and is most commonly described as a "bridge of communication" between developers and operations. Criticise if you will, but when people have their head in code they sometimes don't take into account the bigger picture. Ultimately that's what it's all about. Common tools of the trade include: virtualization, configuration management, CI, and automation of as much as reasonable.
