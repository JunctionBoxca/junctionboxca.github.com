The names Fisher, Nathan Fisher.  I&rsquo;m not into secrets but, I do think everyone is entitled to their [privacy](http://www.eff.org/). I am logically illogical but, aren&rsquo;t we all? I believe in being conscientous to the [planet](http://www.ted.com/talks/graham_hill_weekday_vegetarian.html) we live on but, am not opposed to abusing it&rsquo;s [rock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_climbing) on occassion (perhaps &ldquo;abused by&rdquo; is more accurate).  I have a love-hate relationship with technology; I feel it is simultaneously humanities greatest success and failing (viagra spam, infomercials, and strip mining anyone?!?!?).  The scientific method is great but, science lost it&rsquo;s innocence sometime ago.  The pyramids and most other man-made wonders provide me with simultaneous awe and intense fury; their damned amazing but, represent a permanence of exploitation and enslavement.  I have an inate fear of anything labelled &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo;, unless it&rsquo;s affiliated with Star Trek or the sea.  Speaking of sea being on a boat with the wind in your hair is pretty awesome, as long as it&rsquo;s one of the [wind](http://www.jboats.com/j133/) and not one of these (actully, I won&rsquo;t dignify a powerboat with a link).
